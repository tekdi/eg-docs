# Architecture

#### Usage Scenarios

##### User Group Changes:

When a user is moved from one group to another, the service logs the change, noting the user’s previous group, the new group, and the user who made the change.

##### User Account Activation/Deactivation:

The service logs when a user account is activated or deactivated, capturing the reason for the change (if provided) and who performed the action.

##### Security Audits:

Administrators can review the logged activities to ensure that all user actions are compliant with security policies and to identify any unauthorized actions.

##### Implementation Details

###### Data Storage:
 The logged activities are stored in a secure, tamper-proof database. The data schema supports
 indexing to allow quick search and retrieval of activity logs.

###### APIs:
The service provides RESTful APIs to allow integration with other components of the EdoCert platform and to enable external systems to query the activity logs.

###### Retention Policy:
Activity logs are retained based on the platform’s data retention policy, ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

###### Security Considerations
Access to the Activity and Tracking Service is restricted to authorized personnel only.
Logged data is encrypted both at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.
Regular audits are conducted to ensure the integrity and security of the logged data.
###### Reporting and Analytics
The service includes built-in reporting capabilities that allow administrators to generate detailed reports on user activities.
Analytics tools can be integrated to analyze trends and patterns in user behavior over time.
