# Architecture

### Components
#### User Profile Management

##### User Registration:
    Capture user details during registration, including mandatory and optional profile fields.
#### Profile Fields:
    Define custom profile-specific fields as required by the application.
User Profile Update: Allow users to update their profile information.

#### Authentication

##### Login:
    Authenticate users using their credentials (username/password) via Keycloak.
##### Token Generation:
    Generate and manage access and refresh tokens.
##### Session Management:
Handle user sessions, including login, logout, and session expiration.

#### Authorization

##### Role Management:
    Create and manage user roles using Keycloak.
##### Permission Assignment:
    Assign permissions to roles based on the application's needs.
##### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
    Control access to different parts of the application based on user roles.

#### Integration with Keycloak

##### Keycloak Configuration:
    Set up realms, clients, roles, and users in Keycloak.
##### API Integration:
    Utilize Keycloak’s REST API for user and role management.
##### Single Sign-On (SSO):
    Enable SSO across different applications using Keycloak.

### Service Workflow
#### User Registration
User submits registration details.
Service creates a user profile and stores profile-specific fields.
Service registers the user with Keycloak.

#### User Login

User submits login credentials.
Service authenticates the user through Keycloak.
Service generates access and refresh tokens for the authenticated user.

#### Role Assignment

Admin assigns roles to the user through the service.
Service updates the user's roles in Keycloak.

#### Access Control

User attempts to access a protected resource.
Service checks the user’s roles and permissions via Keycloak.
If authorized, access is granted; otherwise, access is denied.

### Security Considerations
##### Password Management:
    All passwords are securely hashed and stored.
##### Token Security:
Access tokens are securely stored and transmitted using encryption.
##### Audit Logs:
Maintain logs for all authentication and authorization events.

### Keycloak Configuration
##### Realm:
    A Keycloak realm represents a tenant in the system. Each realm can have its own users, roles, and clients.
##### Client:
    A client in Keycloak represents an application that a user logs into. Configure clients for each application.
##### Roles:
    Define roles within Keycloak, which can be assigned to users.

### Integration with Other Services
Notification Service: For sending notifications upon user registration, password reset, etc.
Logging Service: For capturing authentication and authorization events.

### Performance Considerations
Ensure that the service is optimized for handling a large number of concurrent authentication requests.
Implement caching mechanisms where applicable to reduce load on Keycloak.

### Monitoring and Maintenance
Regularly monitor user authentication and authorization logs.
Perform periodic reviews of roles and permissions to ensure they align with current business needs.
