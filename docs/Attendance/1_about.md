# About

The Attendance Service is a core functionality designed to handle and streamline the process of marking attendance within the platform. It supports both self-attendance and attendance marking for others, contingent on the userâ€™s access privileges. The service is integrated with advanced technologies such as AWS Face Recognition for identity verification and GPS-based location detection to ensure the accuracy and legitimacy of attendance records.
