# About

The Cohort Management Service is designed to manage groups (referred to as cohorts) consisting of users with different roles. This service is versatile and can be used in various scenarios where group-based actions are necessary. Below is a detailed overview of the service, including key concepts, functionalities, and use cases.

#### Key Concepts
Cohort: A cohort is a group of users who are grouped together for a specific purpose. Each cohort is distinct and can be customized according to the needs of the use case.

#### Roles within Cohorts
Users can be assigned different roles within each cohort. These roles are specific to the cohort and define the user's permissions and responsibilities within that group. A user can have different roles across different cohorts. For example, a user can be a:

Student in a classroom cohort
Teacher in a teacher training cohort
Coach in a school football team cohort
